Shares of rivals Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter were also down approximately 7% in after-hours.', 'Third-Quarter Figures', ""Adjusted earnings per share amounted to 17 cents, more than double the 8 cents estimated by Refinitiv, but revenue of $1.07 billion fell short of Refinitiv's forecast of $1.10 billion."", ""Snap's community now has 306 million global daily active users (DAUs) as it grew 4% from the figure reported in April and almost 23% from last year's comparable quarter.

It is building insights for parents that reportedly won't compromise privacy or data security.

Unfortunately, these changes are taking place when supply chains should be operating at peak capacity and with peak advertising demand driving peak contestation, and therefore peak pricing."", 'Long-Term Goal Remains Intact', ""In a nutshell, although some degree of business disruption was anticipated due to Apple's improved privacy changes that Spiegel himself praised, the impact was greater as it made it more difficult for advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $1 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of +30%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) Suggests It's 20% Undervalued,"[""In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward."", ""Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' View our latest analysis for Apple ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows.

This is occurring at a time when these partners would normally be operating at peak capacity, generating the strongest and most valuable quarter for ad revenue. But marketers can’t advertise for products they can’t sell.', '“While it is difficult to predict the duration and magnitude of these macroeconomic factors on the businesses of our partners, we have assumed that these headwinds will persist throughout Q4,” said Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen.', 'Snap’s warning cast a shadow over larger ad-dependent rivals including Google, Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., whose shares also fell after the report. Snap tumbled to a low of $52.48 in extended trading.', 'Still, Snap has benefited from the continued migration toward online shopping and digital advertising during the pandemic. Companies of all sizes turned to social media platforms to reach customers who were stuck at home to avoid the spread of Covid-19. As the economy reopens, Snap executives have argued that they expect more users to turn to the app not just to passively ingest entertainment but also to connect with new friends and add updates about their life to their Snapchat Stories -- posts that disappear within 24 hours.', 'Apple’s changes already were impacting Snap’s business in June and July, Spiegel said. In the third-quarter, Snap reported sales increased 57% to $1.07 billion. That compared with the $1.1 billion average projection of analysts. The ephemeral photo-sharing app Snapchat reported 306 million daily active users in the period, beating predictions of 302 million.', 'The Santa Monica, California-based company reported a third-quarter net loss of $72 million, compared to the $145.26 million loss analysts expected. The company projects that daily active users will climb to between 316 million and 318 million in the fourth quarter.Snap has said it expects to deliver revenue growth of more than 50% for several years, in part on the strength of aggressive investment in augmented reality. The company has pushed brands to experiment with customizable advertising and shopping experiences that allow customers to try on clothes, accessories or beauty products on their phones. The app has also added features to its Snap Map such as local restaurant recommendations or information about upcoming concerts and shows in the area.In recent months, Snap has sought to expand the reach of its augmented reality technology with new partnerships.

"October 19, 2021, 8:11 AM",Mark Gurman,Apple Drops Intel in Biggest MacBook Pro Overhaul in Years,"['(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. took the most aggressive step yet to strip Intel Corp. chips from its computers, announcing more powerful homegrown Mac processors alongside a total revamp of its MacBook Pro laptop computers.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg', 'Forget Palm Springs—Santa Fe Is the New Mecca for Modern Architecture', 'Google’s Biggest Moonshot Is Its Search for a Carbon-Free Future', 'A $30 Billion Fortune Is Hiding in China’s Silicon Valley', 'The Top Money Maker at Deutsche Bank Reaps Billions From Singapore', 'Beef Industry Tries to Erase Its Emissions With Fuzzy Methane Math', 'The company showcased the chips at an event Monday called “Unleashed” that also included its latest audio products. The new components, called the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, are 70% faster than its M1 predecessors, Apple said. It also unveiled a redesigned MacBook Pro, adding larger screens, MagSafe charging and better resolution.', 'With the new processors and devices, Apple is aiming squarely at the high-end chips that Intel has provided for the MacBook Pro and other top-end Macs for about 15 years. Last year, Apple started transitioning its low-end Macs to its own M1 Apple Silicon chip. The new chips, however, are a bolder stroke, aiming at far outclassing Intel’s highest-performing products.', 'Apple shares rose as much as 1.4% to $146.80 after the event. They had gained 9.2% this year through the end of last week.', 'The chips include 10 total CPU cores -- the components that handle processing -- up from the eight in the M1 chip. The 10 cores are split into eight high-performance cores and two cores for tasks that require less energy. That compares with four high-performance and four low-performance cores in the M1.', 'Apple is also upping the graphics performance for the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which come with 16 and 32 graphics cores, respectively. That’s up from the seven or eight-core options offered with the M1 Macs. Graphics performance with the M1 Max is as much as four times faster than on the earlier M1 chip, while the M1 Pro is twice as fast, Apple said. It’s also 13 times faster than earlier Intel models.', 'The M1 Pro supports 32 gigabytes of memory, while the M1 Max has up to 64 gigabytes. That’s up from 8GB or 16GB offered with the M1.', 'The new chips are at the center of the most significant update to the MacBook Pro since 2016. The new model comes in 14.2-inch and 16.2-inch screen sizes, and -- like the latest iPad Pro -- the displays use miniLED panels. That technology allows for improved color reproduction. The screens also have 24% thinner borders on the side and a 60% thinner border at the top thanks to a new display cutout. That feature, also called a notch, makes the display look more like the one on an iPhone.', 'The new models have an updated, boxier look and lack the controversial Touch Bar, the touch-screen strip introduced with the 2016 redesign. Apple replaced the Touch Bar with a new circular fingerprint scanner and larger physical function keys. Besides reversing that change from the prior version, Apple is restoring three ports that users missed after they were removed five years ago: the HDMI port, an SD card slot and MagSafe charging.', 'Read more: Other products unveiled at Apple’s event Monday', 'The displays also include ProMotion, a feature that allows the screen refresh rate to reach higher levels for a smoother overall experience. Apple added a similar feature to the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max in September. And the company is adding a 1080 progressive-scan video-chat camera, improving a component that users of earlier MacBook Pros have found subpar. The microphones and speakers were upgraded as well.', 'The HDMI connection makes it easier to tie the laptop to a TV or external monitor, while the SD card slot is a convenient offering for on-the-go photographers. MagSafe, meanwhile, makes its return to the MacBook Pro after the feature was added to the iPhone 12 last year. It uses a magnetic charging adapter for the laptop. That means if the charging cord is tripped on, it will be yanked out -- rather than sending the computer tumbling to the floor.', 'The new 16-inch model can reach up to 21 hours of battery life when watching video, while the smaller 14-inch model has 17 hours, Apple said. The products also support a new fast-charge feature, which can quickly juice the laptop’s battery to 50% from zero.', 'Bloomberg previously reported on Apple’s plans for the MacBook Pro chips, design and other features.', 'Despite the growth of wearables and other mobile devices over the past several years, the Mac has remained a steady seller for Apple. The computer line pulled in almost $30 billion, or about 10% sales, in the last fiscal year. The Mac has also seen its market share grow. It held about 9% of the global personal-computer market in the third quarter, with shipments rising 10% from the period a year earlier, according to data from IDC. That made Apple the second-biggest gainer in the PC market, after Dell Technologies Inc.', 'One challenge Apple may face with its new MacBook Pro is the ongoing chip shortage and supply-chain slowdown sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic. The new computer goes on sale Monday and is due to hit stores next week, starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch model and $2,499 for the 16-inch model, but shipment delays have hampered other recent launches. Customers trying to order Apple’s latest iPhones, watches and iPads are being told that products won’t be delivered until November or December.', 'Apple updated the low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 chip last year, alongside similar updates to the MacBook Air and Mac mini. It revamped the iMac desktop with a new screen, different design and M1 chip earlier this year. Apple previously said it will complete its transition away from Intel in 2022.', 'Once dominant in processors, Intel has been working to regain its footing in the chip industry.
